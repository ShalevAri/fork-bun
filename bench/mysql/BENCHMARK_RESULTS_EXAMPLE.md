# 🔥 MySQL Performance Battle Royale
    
*Generated on: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z*

## The Challenge

Each contender runs **100,000 SELECT queries** with a 100-row LIMIT against a MySQL database containing 100 user records. The battlefield is leveled - same hardware, same database, same query pattern.
