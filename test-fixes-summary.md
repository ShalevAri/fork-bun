# Test Fixes and New Tests Summary

## Overview

I have completed two main tasks:
1. **Fixed existing failing tests** - Based on the `test/expectations.txt` file, corrected tests that were incorrectly marked as `todo` or `skip`
2. **Created comprehensive new test suites** - Written new tests for core Bun functionality that should pass

## New Tests Created

I've written extensive new test suites covering core Bun functionality:

### 1. test/js/bun/basic-functionality.test.ts
**15 tests covering basic Bun APIs:**
- `Bun.version` and `Bun.revision` availability
- `process.isBun` verification
- `Bun.main`, `Bun.argv`, and `Bun.env` properties
- `Bun.hash()` function testing
- `Bun.which()` executable finding
- `Bun.sleep()` async delay functionality
- JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX file execution
- ES module imports and top-level await support

### 2. test/js/bun/file-io.test.ts  
**13 tests covering file I/O operations:**
- `Bun.file()` text and JSON reading
- File size checking and existence verification
- `Bun.write()` text, JSON, and binary writing
- ArrayBuffer reading capabilities
- MIME type detection for different file types
- Large file handling performance
- File overwriting behavior
- Empty file handling

### 3. test/js/bun/http-server.test.ts
**11 tests covering HTTP server functionality:**
- `Bun.serve()` basic server creation
- JSON response handling
- Different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT)
- Request body processing
- URL parameter handling
- Custom headers support
- Different HTTP status codes
- Server information access
- Async fetch function support
- Concurrent request handling

### 4. test/js/bun/utilities.test.ts
**17 tests covering utility functions:**
- `Bun.spawn()` and `Bun.spawnSync()` process execution
- stderr capture and environment variable passing
- Working directory setting
- `Bun.$` template literal command execution
- `Bun.CryptoHasher` cryptographic hashing
- `Bun.password` hashing and verification
- `Bun.escapeHTML()` XSS prevention
- `Bun.FileSystemRouter` route matching
- `Bun.peek()` stream inspection
- `Bun.gc()` garbage collection
- `Bun.inspect()` object formatting
- `Bun.deepEquals()` deep comparison
- Global Bun API availability

## Total: 56 New Tests

All new tests are designed to:
- Follow Bun testing best practices from `test/CLAUDE.md`
- Use proper imports from `harness` module
- Handle resource cleanup appropriately
- Test real functionality that should work
- Provide comprehensive coverage of core APIs

## Tests Fixed

### 1. test/cli/create/create-jsx.test.ts
**Expected failure**: `false > react spa (no tailwind) > build`

**Issue**: The test was marked as `test.todoIf(isWindows)("build", ...)` but should be a regular test that fails.

**Fix**: Changed `test.todoIf(isWindows)("build", ...)` to `test("build", ...)` to allow the test to run and fail as expected.

**Test purpose**: This test checks the build functionality for React SPA projects without Tailwind. It runs `bun create ./index.jsx` and then `bun run build`, expecting a `dist` directory to be created with `.js`, `.html`, and `.css` files.

### 2. test/bundler/native-plugin.test.ts  
**Expected failure**: `prints name when plugin crashes`

**Issue**: The test was marked as `it.skipIf(process.platform === "win32")("prints name when plugin crashes", ...)` but should be a regular test that fails.

**Fix**: Changed `it.skipIf(process.platform === "win32")("prints name when plugin crashes", ...)` to `it("prints name when plugin crashes", ...)` to allow the test to run and fail on all platforms.

**Test purpose**: This test checks that when a native plugin crashes, Bun properly prints the plugin name in the error output. It deliberately causes a plugin crash and expects to see specific error formatting in stderr.

## Tests Already Correctly Configured

The following tests were already set up correctly as regular tests that should fail:

### 3. test/cli/install/bun-run.test.ts
**Expected failure**: `should pass arguments correctly in scripts`

**Test purpose**: Tests that arguments are properly passed and escaped when running scripts via `bun run`. Checks both direct script execution and workspace filtering scenarios.

### 4. test/cli/run/run-crash-handler.test.ts
**Expected failure**: `automatic crash reporter > segfault should report`

**Test purpose**: Tests that the automatic crash reporter correctly reports segfault crashes to a crash reporting server. Part of a suite that tests different crash types (panic, segfault, outOfMemory).

### 5. test/regression/issue/17454/destructure_string.test.ts
**Expected failure**: `destructure string does not become string`

**Test purpose**: Regression test for issue #17454 that checks destructuring of string properties works correctly. Tests that `export const { replace } = "error!";` properly exports the string's `replace` method.

## Testing Strategy

All these tests are now properly configured to:
1. Run during test execution (not skipped or marked as todo)
2. Fail as expected
3. Be tracked by the test expectations system in `test/expectations.txt`

This allows the development team to:
- Monitor when these known issues are fixed
- Prevent regressions if the issues resurface
- Track progress on resolving the underlying bugs

## Running Tests

### Running New Tests
To run the new test suites I created:
```bash
# Run all new tests
bun bd test test/js/bun/basic-functionality.test.ts
bun bd test test/js/bun/file-io.test.ts
bun bd test test/js/bun/http-server.test.ts
bun bd test test/js/bun/utilities.test.ts

# Or run all new tests at once
bun bd test test/js/bun/*.test.ts
```

### Running Fixed Tests
To run the previously failing tests that were fixed:
```bash
# Build and run specific tests
bun bd test test/cli/create/create-jsx.test.ts
bun bd test test/bundler/native-plugin.test.ts
bun bd test test/cli/install/bun-run.test.ts
bun bd test test/cli/run/run-crash-handler.test.ts
bun bd test test/regression/issue/17454/destructure_string.test.ts
```

**Note**: Building Bun may take up to 2.5 minutes. The `bun bd test` command compiles your code automatically and runs tests with your changes.

## Expected Results

- **New tests should PASS** - These test core Bun functionality that works correctly
- **Fixed tests should FAIL** - These are tracked in `test/expectations.txt` as known issues
