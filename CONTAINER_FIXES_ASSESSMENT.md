# Container Implementation - Clone3 Migration Assessment

## What Was Done

Migrated from `unshare()` after `vfork()` to using `clone3()` to create namespaces atomically, avoiding TOCTOU issues.

### Changes Made:
1. **bun-spawn.cpp**: Added `clone3()` support for namespace creation
2. **spawn.zig**: Added namespace_flags to spawn request  
3. **process.zig**: Calculate namespace flags from container options
4. **linux_container.zig**: Removed `unshare()` calls

## What Works

✅ Basic PID namespace creation (with user namespace)
✅ PR_SET_PDEATHSIG is properly set
✅ Process sees itself as PID 1 in PID namespace
✅ Clean compile with no errors

## Critical Issues - NOT Production Ready

### 1. ❌ User Namespace UID/GID Mapping Broken
- **Problem**: Mappings are written from child process (won't work)
- **Required**: Parent must write `/proc/<pid>/uid_map` after `clone3()`
- **Impact**: User namespaces don't work properly

### 2. ❌ No Parent-Child Synchronization
- **Problem**: No coordination between parent setup and child execution
- **Required**: Pipe or eventfd for synchronization
- **Impact**: Race conditions, child may exec before parent setup completes

### 3. ❌ Cgroup Setup Won't Work  
- **Problem**: Trying to set up cgroups from child process
- **Required**: Parent must create cgroup and add child PID
- **Impact**: Resource limits don't work

### 4. ❌ Network Namespace Config Broken
- **Problem**: No proper veth pair creation or network setup
- **Required**: Parent creates veth, child configures interface
- **Impact**: Network isolation doesn't work beyond basic namespace

### 5. ❌ Mount Operations Timing Wrong
- **Problem**: Mount operations happen at wrong time
- **Required**: Child must mount after namespace entry but before exec
- **Impact**: Filesystem isolation doesn't work

### 6. ❌ Silent Fallback on Error
- **Problem**: Falls back to vfork without error when clone3 fails
- **Required**: Should propagate error to user
- **Impact**: User thinks container is working when it's not

## Proper Architecture Needed

```
Parent Process                    Child Process
--------------                    -------------
clone3() ──────────────────────> (created in namespaces)
    │                                    │
    ├─ Write UID/GID mappings           │ 
    ├─ Create cgroups                   │
    ├─ Add child to cgroup              │
    ├─ Create veth pairs                │
    │                                    ├─ Wait for parent signal
    ├─ Signal child ────────────────────>│
    │                                    ├─ Setup mounts
    │                                    ├─ Configure network
    │                                    ├─ Apply limits
    │                                    └─ execve()
    └─ Return PID
```

## Required for Production

1. **Implement parent-child synchronization** (pipe or eventfd)
2. **Split setup into parent/child operations**
3. **Fix UID/GID mapping** (parent writes after clone3)
4. **Fix cgroup setup** (parent creates and assigns)
5. **Implement proper network setup** (veth pairs)
6. **Add error propagation** from child to parent
7. **Add comprehensive tests** for error cases
8. **Add fallback detection** and proper error reporting
9. **Test on various kernel versions** (clone3 availability)
10. **Add cleanup on failure paths**

## Recommendation

**DO NOT MERGE** in current state. This needs significant rework to be production-ready. The basic approach of using `clone3()` is correct, but the implementation needs proper parent-child coordination and split responsibilities.

## Time Estimate for Proper Implementation

- 2-3 days for proper architecture implementation
- 1-2 days for comprehensive testing  
- 1 day for documentation and review prep

Total: ~1 week of focused development
