  // When the feature is properly integrated, these tests should verify:
  // 1. JS files are compressed with .js.gz extension
  // 2. CSS files are compressed with .css.gz extension
  // 3. HTML files are compressed with .html.gz extension
  // 4. JSON files are compressed with .json.gz extension
  // 5. Asset files (images, etc) are NOT compressed
  // 6. Source maps work correctly with compressed files
  // 7. --gz=gzip and --gz=brotli options work correctly
  // 8. --gz cannot be used with --compile
  // 9. Invalid compression types show appropriate errors
  // 10. Compression works with code splitting, minification, etc.
