- after 'client wrote data', bufferSize was 0 when node has it '1': test-tls-buffersize
- socket never closes? test-tls-js-stream.js

createSecurePair not implemented:
These tests are removed in new node versions:
- test-tls-securepair-fiftharg.js
- test-tls-securepair-leak.js

http.request errors because it passes port but no host and path as `localhost:${port}`. _http_client concatenates
that to `localhost:${port}localhost:${port}` which is an invalid url
  - test-tls-over-http-tunnel.js

passes on mac:
- test-tls-junk-closes-server
- test-tls-onread-static-buffer
- test-tls-lookup
