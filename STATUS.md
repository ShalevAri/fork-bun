# HTTP/2 Implementation Status

## ✅ FIXED: HTTP/2 HPACK Encoding Issue Resolved

### What Actually Works
- **ALPN negotiation is implemented and functional** ✅
- ALPN protocol lists are properly configured in SSL contexts ✅
- Servers that support HTTP/2 successfully negotiate it via ALPN ✅
- The infrastructure for protocol-specific SSL contexts exists ✅
- **HTTP/2 connection preface is sent correctly** ✅
- **Initial SETTINGS frame exchange works** ✅
- **Basic frame parsing is implemented** ✅
- **SETTINGS ACK is properly handled** ✅
- **HPACK header encoding now works correctly** ✅
- **All HTTP/2 pseudo-headers are properly encoded** ✅
- **Basic HTTP/2 client-server communication functions** ✅

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Added ALPN Support to uSockets (C layer)
- Extended `us_bun_socket_context_options_t` structure with ALPN fields
- Modified `create_ssl_context_from_bun_options()` to call `SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos()`
- ALPN data is properly passed from Zig to C layer

#### 2. Updated Zig Bindings
- Added ALPN fields to `BunSocketContextOptions` struct in Zig
- Created static ALPN protocol arrays for h2, http/1.1, and both
- Modified context initialization to pass ALPN based on protocol preference

#### 3. Protocol-Specific SSL Contexts
- Created three separate SSL contexts: h1-only, h2-only, and both
- Each context advertises different ALPN protocols
- Contexts are selected based on the `httpVersion` option

### What Still Needs Work
- **Response parsing** - Can't decode incoming HEADERS/DATA frames (fetch hangs on response)
- **No flow control** - WINDOW_UPDATE frames not handled
- **No stream multiplexing** - Only single stream support
- **Minor header decoding issue** - Some garbage in decoded headers

### Test Results
With the HPACK encoding fix, fetch() can now successfully send HTTP/2 requests:
```
Server received headers: {
  ":method": "GET",
  ":scheme": "https",
  ":authority": "localhost",
  ":path": "/test",
  "user-agent": "Bun/fetch-test",
}
```
The headers are properly encoded and sent to the server. However, response parsing still needs implementation.

### What's Missing
1. ~~**Fix HPACK encoding**~~ - ✅ FIXED: Headers now encode correctly
2. **Response header parsing** - Need to decode HPACK in HEADERS frames
3. **Response body assembly** - Need to collect DATA frames
4. **Flow control** - Handle WINDOW_UPDATE frames
5. **Stream state management** - Track stream lifecycle
6. **Error recovery** - Handle RST_STREAM gracefully

### Code Changes Summary
- `packages/bun-usockets/src/libusockets.h`: Added ALPN fields to options struct
- `packages/bun-usockets/src/crypto/openssl.c`: Implemented ALPN configuration
- `packages/bun-uws/src/App.h`: Updated to match new struct size
- `src/deps/uws/SocketContext.zig`: Added ALPN fields to Zig bindings
- `src/http/HTTPContext.zig`: Implemented protocol-specific context creation

## Current State
**HTTP/2 request sending now works in Bun!** The HPACK encoding issue has been fixed. The connection is established, ALPN negotiation succeeds, the initial handshake completes, and headers are properly encoded and sent to servers. Servers correctly receive and process the HTTP/2 requests.

### The Fix
The issue was in `src/bun.js/api/bun/lshpack.zig`. The `encode()` function was returning the number of bytes written from the C++ wrapper, but the calling code expected the new absolute position in the buffer. The fix was simple:
```zig
// Before: return offset;
// After:  return dst_buffer_offset + bytes_written;
```

### Next Steps
1. ~~Debug why HPACK.encode() is only returning 1 byte~~ ✅ FIXED
2. ~~Properly encode all HTTP/2 pseudo-headers and regular headers~~ ✅ FIXED
3. Implement response parsing (HEADERS + DATA frames)
4. Add proper error handling and recovery

The foundation is in place and request sending is functional. Response handling is the next major task.
