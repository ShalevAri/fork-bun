# Worker Bundling Implementation - Initial Status

This is an **initial, partial implementation** of Web Worker bundling for issue #17705. While basic functionality is working, there are still significant gaps and this should be considered a **work-in-progress proof-of-concept**.

## ‚úÖ What's Currently Working

### Basic Infrastructure
- Added `ImportKind.worker` enum value to import record system
- Created `E.NewWorker` AST node with proper struct definition  
- Added `e_new_worker` expression tag to AST system
- Implemented visitor pattern for `e_new_worker` nodes

### Detection & Transformation  
- Successfully detects `new Worker('./path.js')` calls during AST visit phase
- Converts eligible `new Worker()` expressions to `e_new_worker` AST nodes
- Creates import records with `.worker` kind (intentionally not added to current part)
- Basic bounds checking to prevent crashes

### Bundler Integration
- Modified bundler to treat `.worker` imports as dynamic entry points  
- Workers generate separate bundle files (e.g., `worker-axd28k5g.js`)
- Added support in `LinkerContext` for worker imports
- Updated error handling in `ResolveMessage.zig`

### Code Generation
- Implemented `js_printer` support for `e_new_worker` expressions
- Outputs `new Worker(path, options)` syntax
- Preserves optional options parameter

## üöß Known Issues & Limitations

### Path Resolution
- **Major Issue**: Generated `new Worker()` calls still point to temp directory paths instead of bundled worker paths
- Worker path resolution needs integration with bundler's path rewriting system
- No handling of relative path resolution from `import.meta.url` yet

### Testing & Edge Cases  
- Only basic happy-path testing implemented
- No error handling for invalid worker paths
- Missing tests for worker options parameter handling
- No tests for complex worker dependency chains

### Missing Features
- No support for `new URL(relativePath, import.meta.url)` pattern yet
- Worker detection is very basic (only handles direct string literals)
- No dynamic worker path support
- Missing integration with HMR/development mode

## üîç Test Results

Basic functionality verified with simple test cases:

```
Input:  new Worker('./worker.js')  
Output: Separate bundles created:
        - entry.js (contains new Worker() call)
        - worker-axd28k5g.js (contains worker code)
```

## üö® Not Production Ready

This implementation should **not be considered complete or production-ready**. It's a foundational implementation that demonstrates the core concepts but needs significant additional work for:

- Proper path resolution and rewriting
- Comprehensive error handling  
- Edge case testing
- Integration with existing bundler features
- Performance optimization

## üìã Next Steps

1. Fix worker path resolution in generated code
2. Add comprehensive test suite  
3. Handle edge cases and error conditions
4. Integrate with existing bundler path rewriting
5. Add support for dynamic worker paths
6. Performance testing and optimization

*This is an honest assessment of current implementation status. Significant work remains before this would be ready for production use.*
