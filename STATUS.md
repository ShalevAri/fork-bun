# HTTP/2 Implementation Status

## Current State: Not Working

Attempted to implement HTTP/2 support in fetch(). The implementation does not work. Fetch calls using `httpVersion: 2` hang indefinitely.

### What Actually Happens
1. HTTP/2 is negotiated via ALPN
2. Connection preface is sent 
3. SETTINGS frames are exchanged
4. Request HEADERS frame is sent
5. Server receives the request
6. Server sends response
7. **Fetch never completes - hangs forever**

### What Was Implemented
- Basic HTTP/2 frame parsing (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.)
- HPACK header encoding/decoding integration
- HTTP/2 request sending with pseudo-headers
- ALPN negotiation (this part already existed)

### Major Problems
- Response data arrives but isn't processed correctly
- The fetch promise never resolves
- No proper stream state management
- No flow control implementation
- No error handling for protocol violations
- Likely has memory safety issues

### Code Changes
- `src/http.zig` - Added ~500 lines of HTTP/2 code
- `src/http/InternalState.zig` - Added HTTP/2 flags
- Test file created but tests fail/timeout

### Bottom Line
This is an incomplete implementation that doesn't work. HTTP/2 is complex. What exists is a partial attempt that successfully sends requests but fails to handle responses. The code compiles but is not functional for actual use.

HTTP/1.1 continues to work normally.
