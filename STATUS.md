# HTTP/2 Client Implementation Status

This document provides an honest assessment of the current HTTP/2 client implementation in Bun's fetch API.

## Current Implementation Status: **EXPERIMENTAL / INCOMPLETE**

### ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

#### Core HTTP/2 Infrastructure
- **HTTP/2 Frame Handling**: Complete implementation of essential frame types (HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM)
- **HPACK Integration**: Uses existing lshpack library for header compression/decompression
- **Stream Management**: Client-side stream allocation with odd-numbered stream IDs (1, 3, 5, ...)
- **Connection Lifecycle**: HTTP/2 connection preface, settings exchange, and proper teardown
- **Flow Control**: Basic implementation of connection and stream-level flow control

#### Integration Points
- **HTTP2Client.zig**: Core HTTP/2 client implementation (~1,054 lines)
- **HTTP2Integration.zig**: Integration layer with existing HTTP client infrastructure
- **Build System**: Proper CMake integration with lshpack dependency
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites for various scenarios

### ‚ùå Known Issues and Limitations

#### Critical Issues
1. **ALPN Integration Missing**: The implementation does not properly integrate with TLS ALPN negotiation
   - HTTP/2 protocol detection is not working automatically
   - Manual protocol selection is required for testing
   - Real-world HTTPS servers won't negotiate HTTP/2 properly

2. **Connection Management**: 
   - No proper connection pooling for HTTP/2 connections
   - Connection reuse logic may not work correctly
   - Multiplexing benefits are limited without proper connection management

3. **Error Handling**: 
   - Error recovery mechanisms are incomplete
   - Stream reset handling may not work in all scenarios
   - Connection-level errors might not propagate correctly

#### Integration Issues
1. **AsyncHTTP Integration**: The integration with existing AsyncHTTP is incomplete
   - Fallback mechanisms are not thoroughly tested
   - Some code paths may not handle HTTP/2 responses correctly
   - Response streaming integration needs work

2. **Memory Management**: 
   - Potential memory leaks in error conditions
   - HPACK encoder/decoder cleanup may be incomplete
   - Stream cleanup on connection termination needs verification

3. **Threading**: 
   - HTTP/2 client integration with Bun's HTTP thread pool is untested
   - Concurrency issues may exist in high-load scenarios

### üöß Testing Status

#### What Has Been Tested
- Basic HTTP/2 frame parsing and generation
- HPACK compression/decompression functionality
- Simple request/response cycles in controlled environments
- Build system integration and compilation

#### What Has NOT Been Tested
- Real-world HTTPS server compatibility
- High-concurrency scenarios with multiplexing
- Error conditions and recovery
- Memory usage under load
- Performance compared to HTTP/1.1
- Integration with existing Bun applications

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Readiness: **NOT READY**

This implementation should be considered **experimental** and is **NOT suitable for production use** due to:

1. **Incomplete ALPN Integration**: Won't work with real HTTPS servers
2. **Untested Error Handling**: May crash or hang under error conditions
3. **Memory Safety**: Potential leaks and cleanup issues
4. **Performance**: May be slower than HTTP/1.1 due to incomplete optimizations
5. **Compatibility**: May break existing fetch functionality in edge cases

### üìã Required Work for Production

#### High Priority
1. **Fix ALPN Integration**: Implement proper TLS ALPN negotiation in HTTPContext
2. **Connection Pooling**: Add proper HTTP/2 connection reuse and management
3. **Error Handling**: Complete error recovery and stream reset mechanisms
4. **Memory Audit**: Fix all potential memory leaks and cleanup issues
5. **Integration Testing**: Extensive testing with real servers and applications

#### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize frame processing and memory usage
2. **Stream Prioritization**: Implement HTTP/2 stream priority handling
3. **Server Push**: Add support for HTTP/2 server push (if desired)
4. **Configuration**: Add user-configurable HTTP/2 settings

#### Low Priority
1. **HTTP/2 Specific APIs**: Consider exposing HTTP/2-specific features to users
2. **Monitoring**: Add HTTP/2-specific metrics and debugging
3. **Documentation**: User-facing documentation for HTTP/2 features

### üîß Development Recommendations

1. **Disable by Default**: HTTP/2 should be disabled by default until ALPN integration is complete
2. **Feature Flag**: Add a feature flag or environment variable to enable HTTP/2 for testing
3. **Incremental Testing**: Start with controlled environments before enabling for general use
4. **Memory Testing**: Run extensive memory leak detection before production
5. **Benchmark**: Compare performance with HTTP/1.1 to ensure improvements

### üìä Estimated Completion Timeline

- **Minimal Viable HTTP/2**: 2-3 weeks (ALPN + basic error handling)
- **Production Ready**: 1-2 months (full testing, optimization, edge cases)
- **Feature Complete**: 3-4 months (server push, priorities, advanced features)

### üéØ Current Recommendation

**DO NOT ENABLE** this HTTP/2 implementation in production or release builds until:
1. ALPN integration is complete and tested
2. Memory safety has been verified
3. Real-world server compatibility has been validated
4. Performance benefits have been demonstrated

The implementation provides a solid foundation but requires significant additional work before being suitable for end users.
