# Yoga RefCounted Migration Status

## Overview
Migrating Bun's Yoga JavaScript bindings from direct YGNodeRef/YGConfigRef management to proper RefCounted C++ wrappers following WebKit DOM patterns.

## âœ… Completed Work

### Core RefCounted Architecture
- **YogaNodeImpl**: RefCounted C++ wrapper for YGNodeRef
  - Inherits from `RefCounted<YogaNodeImpl>`
  - Manages YGNodeRef lifecycle in constructor/destructor
  - Stores context pointer for YGNode callbacks
  - Has `JSC::Weak<JSYogaNode>` for JS wrapper tracking

- **YogaConfigImpl**: RefCounted C++ wrapper for YGConfigRef  
  - Inherits from `RefCounted<YogaConfigImpl>`
  - Manages YGConfigRef lifecycle in constructor/destructor
  - Has `JSC::Weak<JSYogaConfig>` for JS wrapper tracking

### JS Wrapper Updates
- **JSYogaNode**: Now holds `Ref<YogaNodeImpl>` instead of direct YGNodeRef
  - Uses `impl().yogaNode()` to access underlying YGNodeRef
  - No longer manages YGNode lifecycle directly
  
- **JSYogaConfig**: Now holds `Ref<YogaConfigImpl>` instead of direct YGConfigRef
  - Uses `impl().yogaConfig()` to access underlying YGConfigRef  
  - No longer manages YGConfig lifecycle directly

### GC Lifecycle Management
- **JSYogaNodeOwner**: WeakHandleOwner for proper GC integration
  - `finalize()` derefs the C++ wrapper when JS object is collected
  - `isReachableFromOpaqueRoots()` uses root node traversal for reachability
  
- **Opaque Root Handling**: 
  - `visitChildren()` adds root Yoga node as opaque root
  - Follows WebKit DOM pattern for tree-structured objects

### API Migration
- Updated ~95% of Yoga API calls in JSYogaPrototype.cpp to use `impl()` pattern
- Migrated cloning logic to use `replaceYogaNode()` method
- Updated CMake build system to include new source files

## ðŸš§ Remaining Work

### Compilation Fixes Needed
1. **Header Include Issues**: Need YogaConfigImpl.h in JSYogaConstructor.cpp
2. **Method Name Corrections**: Some calls incorrectly use `yogaConfig()` instead of `yogaNode()` for JSYogaNode objects
3. **Missing Header**: JSYogaPrototype.cpp needs complete YogaConfigImpl.h include

### Testing Required
- Verify Yoga tests pass with new RefCounted implementation
- Check for memory leaks under AddressSanitizer
- Validate GC behavior with stress testing

## Architecture Benefits

The new RefCounted pattern provides:

1. **Automatic Memory Management**: RefCounted handles lifecycle without manual tracking
2. **GC Integration**: Proper opaque roots prevent premature collection of JS wrappers
3. **Thread Safety**: RefCounted is thread-safe for ref/deref operations
4. **WebKit Compliance**: Follows established patterns used throughout WebKit/JSC
5. **Crash Prevention**: Eliminates use-after-free issues from manual YGNode management

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation errors (estimated ~30 minutes)
2. Run full Yoga test suite to validate functionality
3. Performance testing to ensure no regressions
4. Code review and cleanup

The core architecture migration is **complete** - just need to resolve the remaining compilation issues.
