# Bun.spawn Container Implementation

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING (NOT PRODUCTION READY)

The container implementation now uses `clone3()` instead of `unshare()` which fixes the crash, but has critical architectural issues that prevent production use. See CONTAINER_FIXES_ASSESSMENT.md for details.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ New API Structure
The API was successfully updated to the requested aesthetic:

```javascript
const proc = spawn({
  cmd: ["echo", "hello"],
  container: {
    namespace: {
      pid: true,
      user: true,
      network: true,
    },
    fs: [
      { type: "overlayfs", to: "/mnt/overlay", /* options */ },
      { type: "tmpfs", to: "/tmp/scratch" },
      { type: "bind", from: "/host/path", to: "/container/path" },
    ],
    limit: {
      cpu: 50,  // 50% CPU
      ram: 128 * 1024 * 1024,  // 128MB
    },
  },
});
```

### ✅ Code Structure
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/linux_container.zig` - Core container implementation
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/subprocess.zig` - JavaScript API parsing
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/process.zig` - Process lifecycle integration
- `test/js/bun/spawn/container.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

### ✅ Features Implemented (Code Complete)

1. **Namespaces**
   - User namespace with UID/GID mapping
   - PID namespace isolation
   - Network namespace with loopback
   - Mount namespace for filesystem isolation

2. **Resource Limits (cgroupv2)**
   - Memory limits
   - CPU limits (percentage-based)
   - Cgroup freezer for cleanup
   - Ephemeral cgroup creation/deletion

3. **Filesystem Mounts**
   - Overlayfs support
   - Tmpfs mounts
   - Bind mounts (with readonly option)
   - Automatic unmounting on cleanup

4. **Cleanup Guarantees**
   - Process.deinit cleanup on normal exit
   - Container context ownership tracking
   - PR_SET_PDEATHSIG for parent death (child gets SIGKILL if Bun dies)
   - Cgroup freezer to prevent new processes during cleanup
   - Best-effort cgroup removal

## ❌ Current Issues

### 1. **Runtime Crash**
When running with container options, the code panics with:
```
panic(main thread): reached unreachable code
```

The crash occurs in the thread pool code when trying to close file descriptors, likely a secondary failure from container setup issues.

### 2. **Error Handling Bug**
The errno conversion has type issues:
- `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` fails with `os.linux.E__enum_4628.INVAL`
- The enum conversion in `bun.sys.getErrno` isn't working properly
- This causes the error path to fail, leading to the panic

### 3. **Root vs Non-Root Issues**
- User namespaces behave differently when running as root (sudo)
- The current implementation doesn't handle this distinction
- EINVAL when trying to create user namespace as root

## What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **Fix errno conversion** - The `bun.sys.getErrno` usage needs to be corrected to properly convert Linux error codes
2. **Handle root/non-root** - Different namespace setup for privileged vs unprivileged execution
3. **Debug the panic** - Find and fix the unreachable code path that's causing the crash
4. **Test thoroughly** - The code has never successfully run, so there are likely other issues

## Testing Status

- ✅ **Compiles successfully** with `bun bd`
- ✅ **Basic spawn works** without container options
- ❌ **Container spawn crashes** with any container options
- ❌ **Tests cannot run** due to runtime crash

## Environment

Tested on:
- Arch Linux with kernel 6.14.7 (bare metal, not containerized)
- Full namespace and cgroup v2 support available
- Both regular user and root (sudo) tested

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/linux_container.zig`
- `test/js/bun/spawn/container.test.ts`

### Modified Files
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/process.zig` - Added container context lifecycle
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/subprocess.zig` - Added container option parsing
- `src/bun.js/api/bun/spawn.zig` - Added PR_SET_PDEATHSIG support
- `src/bun.js/bindings/bun-spawn.cpp` - Added prctl for death signal

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Fix the immediate crash**
   - Debug the errno conversion issue
   - Fix the unreachable code panic
   - Test basic namespace creation

2. **Improve error handling**
   - Better errno to ContainerError mapping
   - Graceful fallback when features unavailable
   - Clear error messages for permission issues

3. **Handle privilege levels**
   - Detect if running as root
   - Use appropriate namespace flags for each case
   - Document privilege requirements

4. **Simplify initial implementation**
   - Start with just PID namespace (simplest)
   - Add features incrementally once basic case works
   - Ensure each feature works in isolation

5. **Consider alternatives**
   - Could use `systemd-run` when available
   - Could shell out to `unshare` command as fallback
   - May need different approach for production readiness

## Honest Assessment

**The implementation is architecturally complete but practically broken.** The code structure is sound, the API is clean, and the features are well-organized. However, there's a fundamental issue with error handling that prevents any container features from working. 

This needs debugging with a proper development environment where you can:
- Step through with a debugger
- Add logging to trace the exact failure point  
- Test individual system calls in isolation
- Fix the enum/error conversion issues

The crash suggests the error path itself has bugs, which means even when containers fail to setup (which they currently do), the error handling also fails, causing a panic.

**Bottom line**: This is a solid foundation but needs several hours of debugging to get working.
